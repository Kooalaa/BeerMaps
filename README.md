# BeerMaps

This was a school project I participated on my last semester of my second year. The whole project was done in 2 months.

Project idea:
The idea for this project was to create an mobile application that can show and find all the Bars/nightclubs and restaurants that serve alcohol in Finland.
Users are able to find restaurants and rate them on scale 1-5, users can see the overal rating of chosen restaurant. 

Technologies used:
Application is written 100% on kotlin and using android studio, application is currently usable only on android devices.


Usecases:
Users that are interested in knowing what kind of bars are in for example in the location they are currently staying can check from the app which places are worth going to.
The applications main focus is for users that are interested in nightlife.
